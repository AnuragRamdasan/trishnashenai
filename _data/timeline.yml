  quote: So we were all at echoes and I remember most of us being blazed AF, and from whatever I can remember Trish was there, rock solid, taking care of us. Even if any of us were low at some point at the festival, she would come not say anything but just be there besides you and then her vibe is such that it pulls you out of the slump! It's been a pleasure knowing you Gae!

  quote: Trish is not a person she's a vibe!! If you are in the same room with Trishna, you can't help but wonder what are these bursts of fireworks happening in the room. That's the kind of energy that you carry around. Just can't be sad or low when you're around. You're a package of fun, laughter, love and warmth!!

  quote: I remember sleeping with her in the room a night before my wedding talking about how life is changing and she was just there being my biggest support. Trishna was the one who sat with me in my car to the wedding venue and we held hands as I was nervous and excited at the same time. She had a rubber band around her wrist while wearing ethnic and we shared a small laughter - some things never change - we will never change!
