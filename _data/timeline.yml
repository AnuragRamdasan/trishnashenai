  quote: I remember sleeping with her in the room a night before my wedding talking about how life is changing and she was just there being my biggest support. Trishna was the one who sat with me in my car to the wedding venue and we held hands as I was nervous and excited at the same time. She had a rubber band around her wrist while wearing ethnic and we shared a small laughter - some things never change - we will never change!
